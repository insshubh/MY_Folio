## Introduction
Welcome to my web development journey! This document serves as a timeline and reflection of my experiences and progress in the field of web development.

---

## Learning HTML
I started my journey by learning the basics of HTML. HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the foundation of web development, providing the structure for web pages.

## Styling with CSS
After grasping HTML, I delved into CSS to enhance the visual appeal of my websites. Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) allowed me to control layout and design.

## JavaScript Fundamentals
To make my websites interactive, I learned JavaScript. JavaScript is a versatile scripting language that enables dynamic content and user interactivity.

## Building Responsive Websites
Understanding the importance of responsiveness, I explored techniques using media queries and flexible grid systems to ensure a seamless experience across devices.
